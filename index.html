<h1>Hi!</h1>
<p>My name is Laura Orchid, 19 year old mare/girl from Ponyville/Canterlot City. In Equestria, I primarily work as florist selling variety of beautiful flowers. While on human world, I work as a florist as well but I also employed Wallflower as my helper. (I hope she didn't erase my memory :O). Besides that, with Sci-Twi, I'm working as Canterlot High School's IT Admin, managing their computers and server! How cool is that!? :D. Don't forget to follow my author on <a href="https://facebook.com/thinkpony">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/floristpony">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/ponyscape">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/orchidluna">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/@thinkorchid">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lunarwaves.live">Bluesky</a>, and <a rel="me" href="https://equestria.social/@lauraorchid">Mastodon!</a> Fun fact, often times my author likes to virtually hug and kiss me with her blanket. :P</p>
