<h1>Hi, I'm Bronya Rand.</h1>
<p>Supreme Guardian of Belobog, and Commander of the Silvermane Guards. My life in the past wasn't easy. Our planet, Jarilo-VI, was all covered in snow from the Eternal Freeze due to our previous leaders trying to use the Stellaron to bury the Antimatter Legion who invaded this planet 700 years ago. That's until one of our guards Gepard brings Stelle, March 7th, and Dan Heng to discuss how we can seal the Stellaron and recover from this ever-lasting disaster. Yes, although the Legion is buried, we have another problem. The Fragmentum, which corroding every corner of this city and spawned monsters from it. At first, Cocolia agrees to work with the outsiders to seal the Stellaron, but she suddenly changed decisions and commands me to arrest them. After quite a long pursuit, my old friend Seele brings me to the Underworld to find the outsiders. With them, we entered the Great Mine and discussed things with Oleg along the way, especially the truth about Cocolia. I don't believe it at first, but if she's the reason behind this disaster, I'm disappointed. One day, I with Seele and Stelle helped Natasha getting her medicines from her orphanage. Wow, so many memories there, considering I was raised from this place before Cocolia adopted me and make me forget about my past. Along the way, I found a kid who stole Nat's supplies to provide for his family. Seeing his condition, I give him a medal containing a Geomarrow crystal that should be enough to help him pay off his dad's debt. After defeating few more monsters, we got the supplies, bring them to Nat, and we discussed few more things with Oleg on how to negotiate with Svarog. Svarog is against us at first, but once we defeated him, he eventually agrees to give info about the Stellaron, and that's when I realize our previous leader always tried to seal the Stellaron, but why Cocolia trusted the Stellaron for her actions? Then the day finally came. I persuade Cocolia to let go of the Stellaron, but she refused. Eventually Stelle and her friends defeated the Stellaron-absorbed Cocolia, ending this disaster for good. Mother, although your intentions aren't good at all, I won't forget you for raising me and teaching good things. As the leader of Belobog, I give my utmost thanks to Stelle and her friends for helping us seal the Stellaron. Now if you excuse me, I have lots of duties to do. We can talk later~</p>
